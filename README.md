# Machine Vision Lab
This repository contains the implementation of various **Machine Vision Lab experiments** including image processing, filtering, segmentation, edge detection, and texture analysis using Python (OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-image).
---

## üìÇ Lab Experiments

### **Lab 1: Basic Image Operations**
1. Read a black and white image and display:
   - Black and white pixels separately
   - Image in black and white channels
2. Read a color image and separate the **Red, Green, and Blue channels**
3. Convert an **RGB image to CMY (negative image)**
4. Convert an **RGB image to HSI and back to RGB**

---

### **Lab 2: Gray Level Transformations & Filtering**
1. **Image Negative** ‚Äì Inverts intensity values of pixels  
2. **Gamma Correction** ‚Äì Adjusts brightness of an image  
3. **Log Transformation** ‚Äì Enhances dynamic range  
4. **Image Enhancement** ‚Äì Low Pass & High Pass filtering using Gaussian filter  
5. **Noise Filtering** ‚Äì Gaussian filter for denoising  

---

### **Lab 3: Histogram Equalization**
- Implement histogram generation, plotting, and equalization.
- Example with a sample numerical dataset and visualization of histograms and line graphs.

---

### **Lab 4: Spatial Filters**
1. **Median Filter** ‚Äì Removes noise while preserving edges  
2. **Min Filter** ‚Äì Reduces intensity by taking the minimum in a neighborhood  
3. **Max Filter** ‚Äì Enhances bright regions by taking the maximum in a neighborhood  

---

### **Lab 5: Edge Detection**
- Implement edge detection using:
  - **Sobel Operator**
  - **Robert Operator**
  - **Prewitt Operator**

---

### **Lab 6: Image Segmentation**
1. **Thresholding (Binary Segmentation)**  
2. **Region Growing Algorithm**  

üìå Includes a Google Colab link for notebook execution.

---

### **Lab 7: Watershed Segmentation**
- Implements **watershed algorithm** for separating overlapping objects.

---

### **Lab 8: Texture Analysis using GLCM**
- Compute **Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM)**  
- Extract texture features:
  - Contrast
  - Dissimilarity
  - Homogeneity
  - Energy
  - Correlation
  - ASM (Angular Second Moment)  
- Display GLCM matrix and analyze results.
